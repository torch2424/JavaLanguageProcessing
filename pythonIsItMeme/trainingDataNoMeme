And so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past
Stay gold, Ponyboy, stay gold
Christmas won’t be Christmas without any presents!
Hey, Boo
I believe there are monsters born in the world to human parents
Everything was beautiful and nothing hurt
Marley was dead as a doornail
What fresh hell is this
He was dancing, dancing. He says he’ll never die
We’re all damaged, somehow
Life is pain, highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something
My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die
Have a biscuit, Potter
All those moments will be lost in time...like tears in rain
Carpe diem. Seize the day, boys. Make your lives extraordinary
Daddy! My Daddy!
Did you think I'd be too stupid to know what a eugoogly is
Do I look like I give a damn
ET phone home
Do I look like someone who cares what God thinks
Everybody runs, Fletch
Fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy night
Get busy living, or get busy dying
Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room
Go ahead, make my day
Here's looking at you, kid
Here's another nice mess you've gotten me into
Hey, don't knock masturbation. It's sex with someone I love
I am big. It's the pictures that got small
How do you like them apples
I am Groot
I drink your milkshake
I have nipples, Greg, could you milk me
